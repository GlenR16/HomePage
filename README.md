# HomePage
Home page for your browser. \
Can be used as the first page that your browser opens on a new tab. Each button can be changed. Colors as well as font can also be changed from the main css file. \
This is a ongoing project. As and when my sense of styling improves I will keep making changes to this repository. This is just the first of many styles. 
To set this as the new tab page :  \
1.Goto browser settings. \
2.Seearch for new tab page and select "Home Page" option. \
3.Goto the home page settings and select the open this url option. \
4.In that section enter "file:///Path/to/index.html" \
5.Save changes.
